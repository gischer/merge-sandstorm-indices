# Merge-Sandstorm-Indices

This package is meant to reference two or more other sandstorm indices, select packages from them, and merge them into a single index to be provided to a Sandstorm instance as its own app
index. 

This was created to provide a way to distribute apps to a specific Sandstorm installation, rather than the general public, for which they might not be appropriate.
